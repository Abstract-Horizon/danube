        The Danube project consists of several core parts: <a href="core.html">Danube core</a>,
        <a href="services.html">services</a>,
        <a href="http-server.html">http server</a>.
        These components support the running of the server
        and (optionally) any <a href="http-integrations.html">integration</a> with other technologies.
        Aside of these there are a few of satelite sub-projects as <a href="bean-console">Bean Console</a> and
        <a href="danube-webdav">WebDAV</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these elements can configured as POJOs - programmatically or by using
        any of the dependency injection containers such
        as <a href="links.html#Spring">Spring</a>,
        <a href="links.html#Pico">Pico Container</a>,
        <a href="links.html#JBossMicrocontainer">JBoss Microcontainer</a>
        or similar. Danube is written so as not to depend on any configuration utilities, although the main
        development was done using the <a href="links.html#Spring">Spring</a> container.
