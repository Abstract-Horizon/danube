      <p>
        Minimal configuration requirements were considered an important factor during the development of Danube. Consequently most
        classes are provided in this distribution with all required default values (where assigning defaults was sensible and logical).
        Configuring Danube should be a simple job, but when needed fine tuning can be achieved easily.
