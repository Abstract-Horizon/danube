          Version 0.4.5 is released!
        </p>
        <p>
          This release brings couple of tidy-up changes like, for instance moving Adaptable interface into separate 
          Maven project. Also, some bugs are fixed in handling HTTP calls (subsequent requests over the same socket
          for HTTP/1.1) and some bugs in bean-console.
