      <h1>Danube - Project Plan</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Danube's code is highly experimental and API not stable. In following releases of Danube major focus is going to be on
        cleaning up the API (<a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/danube/connection/Connection.html">Connection</a> and
        <a href="api/org/abstracthorizon/danube/connection/ConnectionHandler.html">ConnectionHandler</a> interfaces mainly, but also
        suggested API for cookies and session services).
        Secondly, documentation and example code is going to be updated and enhanced.
        Thirdly, attention is going to be moved to implementation of <code>HTTP/1.0|</code> and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> protocols.
        At the moment implementation is doing only the most necessary work without any proper handling of these protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low priority work is going to be done on optimisation of current integrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        More detailed plan is to be defined shortly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Integration</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the current integrations (SWF, FreeMarker, Velocity, Tapestry and JSF)
        other technologies are going to be evaluated as potential candidates for being integrated  with danube.
        The following is a non-exhaustive list of technologies that are going to be investigated:
        <ul>
          <li>Wicket (controller and view part of MVC)</li>
          <li>WebWorks</li>
          <li>Java Servlets and Server Pages (JSP) (controller and view part of MVC)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Beside design, development and documentation of Danube project there will be more work done in infrastructure area as
        introducing bug tracking system, organising cvs access, investigate reasons for switching to some other versioning system (subversion), etc...
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Testing and Performance Optimisations</h2>
      <p>
        As primarily experimental project these are, unfortunately, very low priority tasks for the moment. But they are not forgoten or
        not planned for. Comprehensive unit tests are planned in some later stages and they will be followed by performance
        tests too. These should, then lead to improved code - several techniques are already thought of.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Demos and Example Code</h2>
      <p>
        There is a plan for online demonstration of the way Danube is working: using bean explorer and similar applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, example code is going to be enhanced to use more of the features Danube and integrated tehcnologies are providing.
        Good example is Tapestry's comprehensive example.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the example code documentation is going to be updated accordingly and new content to be added.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Help and Publicity</h2>
      <p>
        Every kind of help is more then welcome - from coding, designing to testing (using it) or commenting on it.
        If interested in contributing to design, development, code or infrastructure of Danube or you have suggestions or
        comments please feel free to contact us on <a href="danube at abstracthorizon.org">danube at abstracthorizon.org</a> or use
        <a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org/forum/index.php?c=7">forums</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since in following releases Danube's API can become more stable and implementation more &quot;serious&quot; it is planned for more
        attention to be drawn to Danube as an alternative to existing web servers.
